I am currently a senior undergraduate student at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), double majoring Physics and Computer Science. My research and career interest is in astrophysics and data science, with the focus on using the modern observational data to understand the stellar population and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group.<br/><img src='/images/IMG_5933.JPG'width="200">"
