Hi! I'm Keyi Ding (丁可怿, pronounced Keh-ee Ding). I am currently first year graduate in astronomy at [University of Maryland-College Park](https://umd.edu/). I did my undergraduate study at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), double majoring in Physics and Computer Science. My research and career interest is in astrophysics and data science, with the focus on using modern observational data to understand the stellar population and evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies in the Local Group.
